              This is undoubtedly the most difficult part of any training routine. There are a number of things that can go wrong with this part of any sort of training program. Yet, this part of any program is the most important of any part. Personally, this part of my training has been the most difficult. I am a very anxious person, and I frequently have little anxiety attacks. When this happens, the way that I cope is with eating. I eat because when I eat, not only does it taste good, but I also do not think about anything else. This makes it especially appealing because it prevents me from thinking about the future. If any of what I have just said applies to your life, please keep on reading. If this is not you, then please feel free to check out some of my recipies.

              Although I am not saying this is a solution, this is what I have found works best for me. My diet currently consists of 100g of fat, under 100g of carbohydrates, and 120g of protein. I use a calorie counter, but I do not count the calories. I only use it to keep tabs on my macros. These numbers are also just goals and I aim for those goals, but still eat when I am hungry. It is also important to pay attention to your hunger. Since I get so anxious so easily, I often mistake my anxiety for hunger. If you have a problem with binge eating or eating to soothe anxiety issues then this could help you. It is also utterly important that you eat well! This is so is an integral part of feeling satiated! If you eat shitty food, you will feel shitty and eat more shitty food! I am talking no sugar, limit sugar alcohols/artificial sweeteners, and eat as natural as you can with as little preservatives as possible.  Also, if you have any questions I would be more than willing to answer them. </p>

            <h2 class="sectionTitle">Tried Weight Loss Methods</h2>
            <p class= "sectionParagraph">
                In this program, you are most likely trying to loose weight and gain some muscle while you are at it. There are many different approaches you can take to loose weight, but the important thing is that you commit to whatever nutrition change you choose. The core concept in this plan is to be consuming less calories than you are outputing. Having a calorie counter is key for this nutrition lifestyle and program. You need to be focused on eating 200-400 calories less than your basal metabolic rate which you can find by clicking <a href="http://www.active.com/fitness/calculators/bmr">Here</a>. I would start you nutrition change with just trying to eat less than your bmr while maintaining a 30% protein, 30% fat, 40% carbohydrate macro-nutrient profile. If you are able to eat consistently under your bmr while having enough energy to continue your life and fitness endeavors, then this is the best option for you. If you are having trouble achieving this, then there are a couple of different nutrition styles that you might be able to try out. 
  					
  						One of the different styles you may have success with is called Keto Dieting. This is essentially an attempt to convert your body from using carbohydrates as fuel to using fat or lipids as fuel. This method is difficult if your lifestyle is dependent on your energy. The conquest to become "keto adapted" takes a toll on your energy levels. The macro profile for this type of diet is something like 70-75% fats, 20-25% protein, and 5% carbohytrates. This may sound like it may be counter intuitive, but the research has shown that, once keto adapted, the body eats away body fat for energy instead of just waiting for the next large carbohydrate splurge. I encourage you to do your own research into this method. I will say that I did have fairly significant success with this diet. I lost 15lbs and gained 5lbs of lean muscle over the course of 5 months. One big mistake that people make is consuming large amounts of protein. This will be counter productive to the process because excess protein is stored very similar to carbohydrates, as glycogen in the cells instead of fat. In consuming most of your calories from fat, the goal is that you will begin to feel more satiated for a longer period of time without having to eat and have a longer span of energy after each meal. The final important guideline is to eat healthy fats. This can be anything from coconut oil to sunflower oil, but it is imperitive that you stay as far as you can away from trans fats!
  					
  						Another style is a method called fasting. This nutrition lifestyle can take many forms. There are several articles talking about the different types, which I again urge you to research. This method does not require you to change your macros, but simply limits the time in which you are allowed to eat. One of the types requires you to eat your normal macros and calorie deficit for five days followed by two days of significantly reduced caloric intake. This would look something like Monday through Friday eat 1600-1800 calories and then Saturday through Sunday eat around 600 calories. I have not personally tried this method, so I do not know if it would work for me particularly. Yet, there are several documented accounts of this type of fasting making significant differences in many lives. The type of fasting that I have personally tried is called intermittent fasting. Intermittent fasting is when you have a fasting time window and an eating time window every day. This would look something like fasting from 8pm to noon the next day, then eating from noon to 8pm. That method is called the 16:8 method. But, you could also try 15:9 and even 14:10 in order to get accustomed to fasting and then steadily increasing your fasting time while decreasing your eating window. In my experience, this was very difficult for me due to my work and school schedules. My lifestyle requires that I have energy in the ealy hours of the morning and without eating, it was just not possible for me. But, this does not mean that it has not worked for others who also have hectic lives. 
  					
  						There are other tricks (or methods) out there for those people (myself included) that have trouble eating a caloric deficit. I believe that the most important thing is just trying these methods out. Everyone is different so different weight loss methods are going to help people and others are not going to be beneficial. It is also important that you do not feel like you have failed if you tried one of the methods and it did not work for you. Failure is a part of life and (as I am sure you already know) it is what you learn about yourself from attempting these methods that is true success. Ergo, do not become discouraged, but instead become motivated to find the method that works for you!
