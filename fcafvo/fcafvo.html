They help us with a wide range of activities ranging fro taking hotline shifts on our crisis line to organizing Awareness Month events. Volunteers must be 18 years of age or older to provide on–call services to clients, have a valid driver’s license, provide proof of insurance, and legally able to sign a binding contract. Individuals wishing to become a volunteer for the program must successfully complete the 40 hour training as prescribed by DVS Rules & Regulations, pass a personal interview with the Executive Director or Associate Director of the program, pass a criminal and child abuse background check and be willing to sign a perpetual confidentiality agreement concerning victim/service user contacts.</strong></div>

                Here at the Alliance we feel that there is incredible healing power in sharing stories. The power of story lies in changing the narrative from one of victimization to a story of survival, strength and courage. When we Stand Up, Speak Up, and Listen Up we are able to take back control of our stories and redefine them in our own terms, and we are no longer defined by the story itself. 
 
                Sharing your story of personal survival or sharing on behalf of someone you know may help you on your journey to wholeness. If you are interested in sharing your story simply click the link below and email it to director@fcafvo.org</strong>
